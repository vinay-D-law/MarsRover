####I have made 2 projects one console application which implements Mars Rover and one test project which has unit tests for the same. 

## Console App 

-> Application is about a Mars Rover/Robot which can move forward in any direction North, South, East and West. 
-> In order to change direction it has 2 ooperations rotate Left or Rotate Right. 

Task 
-> A rover controller can send command messages to the rover and make it perform the above movement tasks. 
-> Rover can only move on the plateau and will not perform the move forward operation if it is at the edge of the plateau.
